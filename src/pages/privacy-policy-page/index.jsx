                  The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you
                  have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
                  personalize Helius pages, or register with Helius site or
                  services, a cookie helps Helius to recall your specific
                  information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process
                  of recording your personal information, such as billing
                  addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to
                  the same Helius website, the information you previously
                  provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Helius
                  features that you customized. We may also use cookies for
                  targeted advertising purposes. You have the ability to accept
                  or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept
                  cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to
                  decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
                  cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the
                  interactive features of the Helius services or websites you
